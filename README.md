# Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop

## Big Data
* Generated in huge volumes, could be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
* Arrives continuously at enormous speed from multiple sources
* Distributed on the cloud and server farms

### Bits, bytes and more
* Bits = 0 or 1
* 8 Bits = 1 Byte
* 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte (KB)
* 1024 KB = 1 Megabyte (MB)
* 1024 MB = 1 Gigabyte (GB)
* 1024 GB = 1 Terabyte (TB)
* 1024 TB = 1 Petabyte (PB)
* 1024 PB = 1 Exabyte (EB)
* 1024 EB = 1 Zettabyte (ZB)
* 1024 ZB = 1 Yottabyte (YB)

### Five V's of Big Data
* **Velocity**
  * Attributes - Batch, Close to real time, Streaming
  * Drivers - Improved connectivity and hardware 
* **Volume**
  * Attributes - Petabytes and above
  * Drivers - Increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors, scalable infrastructure
* **Variety**
  * Attributes - Data from machines, people and processes, complexity, structure, origin
  * Drivers - Mobile technologies, scalable infrastructure, resilience, fault recovery, efficient storage and retrieval
* **Varacity**
  * Attributes - Consistency and completeness, ambiguity, integrity
  * Drivers - Cost and traceability, robust ingestion, ETL mechanisms
* **Value**

### Parallel processing
***Linear processing*** is the traditional method of computing a problem where the problem statement is broken into a set of instructions that are executed sequentially till all instructions are completed successfully. If an error occurs in any one of the instructions, the entire sequence of instructions is executed from the beginning after the error has been resolved.

***Parallel processing -*** The problem statement is broken down into a set of executable instructions. The instructions are then distributed to multiple execution nodes of equal processing power and are executed in parallel. Since the instructions are run on separate execution nodes, errors can be fixed and executed locally independent of other instructions. Advantages of parallel processing:
* Reduce processing time
* Less memory and compute requirements needed
* Flexibility - execution nodes can be added or removed from the processing network depending on the problem complexity
