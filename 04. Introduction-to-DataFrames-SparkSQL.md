### RDD Transformation
* Create a new RDD from existing one
* "Lazy" becasue the results are only computed when evaluated by actions
* For example, the `map` transformation passes each element of a dataset through a function and returns a new RDD

### RDD Actions
* Actions return a value to driver program after running a computation
* Example, `reduce` action aggregates all the elements of an RDD and returns the result to the driver program

### The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
* A graphical data structure with edges and vertices
