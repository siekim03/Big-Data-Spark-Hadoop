### RDD Transformation
* Create a new RDD from existing one
* "Lazy" becasue the results are only computed when evaluated by actions
* For example, the `map` transformation passes each element of a dataset through a function and returns a new RDD

### RDD Actions
* Actions return a value to driver program after running a computation
* Example, `reduce` action aggregates all the elements of an RDD and returns the result to the driver program

### The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
* A graphical data structure with edges and vertices
* Every new edge is obtained from an older vertex
* In Apahce Spark DAG, the vertices represents RDDs and the edges represent operations such as transformations or actions
* If a node goes down, Spark replicates the DAG and restores the node

### Transformation and Actions
1. Spark creates the DAG when creating an RDD
2. Spark enables the DAG Schedular to perform a transformation and updates the DAG
3. The DAG now points to the new RDD
4. The pointer that transforms RDD is returned to the Spark driver program
5. If there is an action, the driver program that calls the action evaluates the DAG only after Spark completes the action
